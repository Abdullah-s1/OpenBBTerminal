## Getting Started with Telegram

Now that you have added the bot to your Telegram server you can get started with running commands.

To use it, you need to type slash commands in the chat. A slash command starts with a / followed by a keyword and an optional argument. For example, /cd AAPL will show you the daily chart for Apple stock.

To see all the available commands, you can type /help in the chat. This will show you a list of commands and their descriptions. You can also tap on any command to use it directly. Some of the most popular commands are:

- /cd TICKER: Shows the daily chart for a given stock ticker.
- /c3m TICKER: Shows the 3-month chart for a given stock ticker.
- /flow TICKER: Shows the current price and other information for a given stock ticker.
- /c DOGE: Shows a chart for the crypto symbol provided.

That's it! You're ready to use OpenBB Telegram Bot and explore the markets. Have fun!
