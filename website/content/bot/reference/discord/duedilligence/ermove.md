# ermove

This command allows the user to retrieve the Display implied move (DIM) for a stock based on the current option prices. The command "/dd ermove" is followed by the stock ticker, in this case "AMD", to get the implied move for the specified stock. The implied move is a measure of how far the stock is expected to move during the option's expiration.

### Usage

/dd ermove ticker
